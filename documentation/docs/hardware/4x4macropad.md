## Description

This is a 4x4 Keyboard/keypad/macropad kit for you to build a 16 key macropad with a Raspberry Pi Pico. All you need are 16 MX mechanical switches and keycaps and about an hour for assembly.

## Build Instructions - Summarized

**Bottom PCB**
- Solder RPI Pico on bottom plate

**Top PCB**
- Solder Diodes on Top Plate - make sure that the band on the diode is near the heavier line of on the silkscreen - or the square pad (depends on the top plate)

**Join Top/Bottom PCB**
- Cut the headers and sockets in group of 4.  
- Join/connect the Header and Socket groups together 
- Line up the top/bottom PCB so that the sockets are all on the same side (top or bottom - I usually have the pins at the bottom) 
- make sure that the top plate can be read and has the same orientation as the bottom plate (Need pictures)
- Solder the Sockets 
- Solder the pins 
 
**Solder Switches**
- Disconnect the top/bottom PCB making sure to pull straight not to bend the pins
- Install the switches through the PCB. If you have a switch plate (a grid) push the switches through the switch plate as you install them on the PCB
- Inspect that all switch pins go through the PCB.
- Solder the switches 
- Reconnect the Top/Bottom PCB
- Install keycaps

* [Download CircuitPython UF2 file](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)
* Enter the bootloader by pressing the reset switch while holding Boot switch pressed
* Copy the UF2 file to the RPI drive.
